## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be downloaded directly from: 
- https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/32m/

Extract the content and put them in this folder. The layout should look like this: `data/ml-32m/ratings.csv`

You will also need to convert the links.csv file to a .json file, this can be done via many online converters. Put the file in the same folder as the links.csv and name it links.json
